# EDX Courses
In this mini project of Data Visualization and Analysis, we have learnt the use of Pandas which is a software library of Python used for data manipulation and analysis.

For Data Visualization we have used Matplotlib, Plotly and Seaborn, which are Python plotting libraries covering wide range of charts and graphs. The following types of graph has been used:

1. Heat Map

2. Radar Chart

3. Bar Graph

4. Pie Chart

5. Bubble Chart

6. Donut Chart

7. Scatter Plot

We selected a dataset of edx courses from Kaggle and performed data cleaning, analysis, and visualization of certain questions and performed some basic function like calculating sum, mean, count, splitting and appending items in list.
